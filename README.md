# Click Bros
A silly little game about clicking and collecting stars.

# Credits
All the assets used, except for the music and protagonist, come from the PhaserJS
tutorial, licensed under CC4.0-BY. All the other assets have been made by me, with the
music being a cover of Will Wood's I/Me/Myself, created using the Commodore 64's SID
chip for the sound.

# How to play
use the up key or spacer to jump (You can also click on the screen), and the down
key to go down faster. Collect as many stars as you can, and become the richest
star-grazing alien in the universe!
