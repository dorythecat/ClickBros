# Click Bros
A silly little game about clicking and collecting stars.

# Credits
All the assets used, except for the music and protagonist, come from the PhaserJS
tutorial, licensed under CC4.0-BY. All the other assets have been made by me, with the
music being a cover of Will Wood's I/Me/Myself, created using the Commodore 64's SID
chip for the sound.
